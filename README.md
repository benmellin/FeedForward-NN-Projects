# NN-projects
## This repository contains jupyter notebook files from my class on Neural Networks
- The class is Mike X Cohen's "A Deep Understanding of Deep Learning"
- The projects in here are my unique solutions to projects from the class.
- Much of the code has been adapted from the class.

### Heart_disease_pred
- The goal of this project is to create a neural network to predict if a patient has heart disease, based on some clinical features.
- Here is a link to the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease
- I use the pytorch library for the implementation of this project.
- My NN performs with around 80% accuracy after training on the dev and test sets.
